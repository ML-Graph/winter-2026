### 1. Background and Problem Formulation - 10%
- **Background**: 
  - What is the general background of the problem you are working on?
    - I want to develop a better paper categorization system
- **Problem Formulation**: 
  - Under the general topic, what specific problem is your project addressing?
    - I want to develop a machine learning model/algorithm to take input of the paper, output the paper topic (machine learning, computer system, human-computer collaboration, etc.)

### 2. Data Mining Problem - 10%
- **Data Collection and Store**: 
  - What data are you looking to kick off your project? How do you collect them? What data structure do you use to represent them?
    - I collect Cora/Citeseer/Pubmed Data from somewhere (e.g., a paper, a GitHub repository, Hugging Face, etc.), and I use an adjacency list to store their connection and a matrix to store their node feature
- **Data Mining**: 
  - What kind of data mining problem do you need to do and why? 
    - I need to analyze the network homophily/heterophily since leveraging this property might help me develop a better machine learning model for paper classification.
  - How do you do it?
    - I calculate for every edge, the two ending points, whether they are in the same class or not, and quantify the average ratio as a homophily ratio
  - What kind of pattern do you find? How do you present your findings/analysis?
    - I find that in many paper citation networks, the homophily is pretty high. Using Number/Table/Figure, etc.


### 4. Method - 30%
- **Algorithm Design/Implementation**: 
  - What data mining/machine learning algorithms are you designing or applying to tackle the problem?

### 5. Experiment and Discussion - 20%
- **Experimentation**: 
  - Conduct experiments to verify that the proposed method works.
- **Discussion**: 
  - Analyze and discuss the results of the experiments.

Here is an example of one-course project.
